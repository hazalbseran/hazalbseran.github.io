        <p class="lead mb-4">Just a second-year Political Science/Law and Society Student living her best life. I am Hazal Seran and I am currently in the US studying at the University of California Riverside, trying to become the best coorperate lawyer possible. I moved from Turkey two years and a half ago to be able to study here in the United States. I have a younger sister who goes to high school in LA and my mom who works at a chemistry company named AMGEN who lives with her back in LA. My dad has his own company and he is currently in Ukraine. I also have a dog with a character named Toby. He is a Golden Retriever. I have completed all of my underdivision classes so far in UCR and I am on my way to complete my breath requirments and afterwards I will be moving up to my upper division courses. Hopefully I will be graduating in 2026 Spring. I am looking forward to it. <br><br>

          Alongside my family and a little bit of my bacground. I am currently part of the Model United Nations Club of our school. I am the deputy for our fundraising committee and I went to multpile conferences and won many awards representing UCR. I went to New York, Germany and attended conferecnes within UCR and RCC. This club gives me the opportunity to meet different people from all around the world since it is an international club with peoplw who can attend from all over the world. I get to taste different cultural foods, see different cultural aspects and discuss politics along the way. The next genereation is the future and I am part of that genereation who can change up this messed up world. Even though the club I am in is the Model version of the UN, it is still something. Us students in the club put in the effort to write policies and discuss worldwide issues to put an end to them. We have to start from one poin in order to be able to have a better future. <br><br>

          During my free time I enjoy going to listen to music, paint and read. I am also an extrovert so I enjoy my time around people. I like going to new coffee shops to explore them with my friends occasionally. I like to travel a lot too. After I am done with my four years at UCR I am planning on having a gap year so that I can go and travel around Europe. I want to go backpacking with my frineds from Turkey with a train called Inter Rail. It is a train that travels all over Europe. After I am done travelling for almost a year I plan on coming back and going to Law School. Preferably Harvard. I want to become a coorperate lawyer and work for big cooperations. I may only be a second year Political Science/Law and Society major, but I am working my way up to it.
